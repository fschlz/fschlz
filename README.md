I'm Francisco.
I build machine learning and analytics tools, products and pipelines that make life easier for companies and teams.

Currently, I am a consultant in the analytics space (mostly in the Healthcare sector right now), focusing on productionizing data science and ML POCs & projects (MLOps).
I started my path as a Data Scientist with roots in economics, but I've since moved on to do more technical things.
Now I'd descibe myself as an ML Engineer as I spend much less time modeling and much more time building out structures and thinking about how the individual parts of projects should connect between themselves but also how they integrate into the rest of the company.

Before becoming a consultant at the [Positive Thinking Company](https://positivethinking.tech) I optimized & buildt ML solutions and tools at [Exactag](https://exactag.com) (AdTech business).

## 🤖 Tech

My main languages are Python + SQL and I am learning more about web-technologies and infrastructure, as well as DevOps, to improve as an ML Engineer.
Besides the mentioned languages I also have initial exposure to a couple others like Java, JavaScript, Scala and Go.

## 🎓 Academia

I'm not native to CS, as my background is in Economics & Business Administrations.
However, I'm stepping up my engineering game by doing a Master's degree (extra-occupational) in Data Science at Uni Mannheim & University of Applied Sciences Albstadt-Sigmaringen.

## ☕️🌲 Leisure

Apart from coding I love specialty coffee (Ethiopian & Costa Rica 👌🏼) and being outdoors. I run, I hike, I climb.
