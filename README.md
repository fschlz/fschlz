I'm Francisco.

I make life easy for ML & AI teams by building tools, automation pipelines, and providing necessary infrastructure.

Currently, I am the **MLOps lead at [knecon.com](https://knecon.com)**.

Besides that I'm helping my 3 co-founders **make [Niche Mates](https://nichemat.es) into a HoldCo**.

Previously, I worked as a ML Engineer at [Positive Thinking Company](https://positivethinking.tech) (mostly healthcare) & worked myself up from Intern -> Jr. Data Scientist -> Data Scientist -> ML Engineer at [Exactag](https://exactag.com) (AdTech).

## 🤖 Tech

My hometurf, to no-one's surprise, is Python + SQL.
I'm very familiar with both and am most comfortable on the backend.

To build out MLOps pipelines / systems I need K8s, Docker, CI/CD pipeline scripts, IaC, and servers - most of which are in the cloud.
By now, I've worked a lot with Azure + Terraform and am getting comfortable with running my own K8s stacks.

I had the chance to work on a few web applications w/ JavaScript (React/Next.JS).

And most recently, I am working a lot with generative AI / LLMs (OpenAI, Mistral, ...).

I'm a big fan of visualization and organized workflows. So, I spend a fair amount of time in whiteboarding tools to plan out infrastructure (Excalidraw, Figma, Miro, ...), and project management + documentation tools (Atlassian Suite, Notion, ClickUp).

For a detailed summary of all my projects, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter/X or LinkedIn (linked below).

## 🎓 Academia

I hold a B.Sc. in Econ & Business from the Goethe Uni in Frankfurt (GER).

I started a Data Science Master programme, but found it hard to dedicate myself fully while also working full-time and eventually running my own company.

I'm a self-starter and like to forge my own path. Anything I need, I like to teach myself in a hands-on manner.

## ☕️🌲 Leisure

Apart from building products & learning to become an entrepreneur, I love specialty coffee (Ethiopian & Costa Rica 👌🏼) and being outdoors.
I run, I hike, I climb.
