I'm Francisco.
I love to build machine learning and analytics tools that make life easier for companies and teams.

My job title is Data Scientist, but I am more on the technical side of things.
I've been optimizing/building ML pipelines and developing tools at Exactag (AdTech business) since 2,5 years now.

## 🤖 Tech

My main languages are Python + SQL and I am learning more about web-technologies and infrastructure to become a ML Engineer.
Besides the mentioned languages I also have initial exposure to a couple others like Java, JavaScript, Scala and Go.

## 🎓 Academia

I'm not native to CS, as my background is in Economics & Business Administrations.
However, I'm stepping up my engineering game by doing a Master's degree (extra-occupational) in Data Science at Uni Mannheim & University of Applied Sciences Albstadt-Sigmaringen.

## ☕️🌲 Leisure

Apart from coding I love specialty coffee (Ethiopian & Costa Rica 👌🏼) and being outdoors. I run, I hike, I climb.
