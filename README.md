## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I'm Francisco.

I lead, I strategize, and I make life easy for companies by building ML & AI-supported automation services.

Currently, I'm working on growing [Niche Mates](https://nichemat.es/), together with my 3 co-founders.

Previously I was the **MLOps lead at [knecon.com](https://knecon.com)**.

Before that, I worked as a ML Engineer at [Positive Thinking Company](https://positivethinking.tech) (boutique consultancy, I was in the healthcare sector)
& worked myself up from Intern -> Jr. Data Scientist -> Data Scientist -> ML Engineer at [Exactag](https://exactag.com) (AdTech).
